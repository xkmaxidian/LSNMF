# LSNMF

Xiaoke Ma*, Wei Zhao, Wenming Wu.  Layer-Specific Modules Detection of Cancer Multi-layer Networks.


Overview:

This is code to do layer-specifc modules clustering of multi-layer networks given in the "experiment" section of the paper: 

Xiaoke Ma*, Wei Zhao, Wenming Wu. "Layer-Specific Modules Detection of Cancer Multi-layer Networks".

The coding here is a generalization of the algorithm given in the paper. LSNMF is written in the MATLAB programming language. To use, please download the LSNMF folder and follow the instructions provided in the “README.doc”.

Files:

LSNMF.m - The main function.

run_LSNMF.m - A script with multi-layer networks data to show how to run the code.

syn_16.mat, merge.mat - Two simulated multi-layer networks for the experiment. 

ClusterMeasure- Modules clustering performance evaluation.
